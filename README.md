# Disaster-Rescue-Planner-V2
This project aims to apply operations research and theory of graphs to design an effective evacuation network in the event of a disaster natural.
Our Task is to create a model of the risk areas, evacuation routes and rescue centers as a graph,
then optimize the network to maximize the security and speed of the evacuation operation.
